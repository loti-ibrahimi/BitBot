# BitBot
Semester 2 - Year 2: Embedded IoT Project, where I worked as part of a team collaboration in the creation of BitBot. 
Our class was split up into small teams of 4 of whom worked together to each create their own bots. Different roles were assigned and alot was learnt from this experience as a whole. 

I've included my project report along in the folder of this repository, where I take you through the journey from start to finish of how we came about making BitBot.

The different files which were used, such as the RoboRealm files alongside the VBScript files which accompany it.
